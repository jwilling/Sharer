Small Mac app to upload files to an SFTP server after dragging them to the status bar or the dock.

Simplified BSD license.

To do:
- Build preferences for things such as:
	- An option to hide the dock icon
	- A way to configure the server to upload to, so we don't have to hardcode credentials into the app
